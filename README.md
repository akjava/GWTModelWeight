Basic
--------
If you are familiar with Blender Posing/Skinning,don't need this app.
Blender can do Most of things this app can.

This apps main purpose is skinning  Manuel Bastioni Lab Character's(http://www.manuelbastioni.com/) cloth/hair/item.

Actually Manuel Bastioni Lab blender plugin has a such function.but I can't understand how to use.

Right now modifying skinning character itself not support yet.[Issue #11](https://github.com/akjava/GWTModelWeight/issues/11)
